# GorillaXS.Friends
GorillaFriends integration for GorillaXS

Get XSOverlay notifications when:
- Your friend(s) leave or join your room
- The room you join has your friend(s) in it

This mod does not explicitly require GorillaFriends and you will still get friend notifications for players you have previously friended with GorillaFriends, even if you don't have GorillaFriends installed.
